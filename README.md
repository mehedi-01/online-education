# online-education
Bangladesh has too many challenges to establish a wide and successful online education 
system in Bangladesh. The major challenges are high-speed internet coverage in the whole 
country and poor studentâ€™s affordability to use internet and computer. Besides, developed
 assessment and quality assurance system, students motivation, teachers training are some
  of more challenges.

Online education would be a good option if we could make it more engaging, quality assured
and less time-consuming with a developed assessment process.
